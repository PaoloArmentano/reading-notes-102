### Growth Mindset
For me the growth mindset is the understanding that intelligence is not a set trait, but rather a skill that can be improved with practice.

### I can remind myself to stay in the growth mindset by:
-Thinking back to all the times I thought I couldn't do something and did it in the through sheer hard work.
-Reminding myself that the idea of fixed mindset is an outdated concept that was due to our lack of understanding of the human mind and potential.
